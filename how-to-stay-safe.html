		<p class="para">Air quality is an important factor in our environment and should thus play an important role in our lifestyle. Keeping yourself and your friends and family safe in today's world requires understanding the effects of air pollution
			on your body and how your lifestyle needs to adapt based on the current air quality. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is divided into several categories of severity, these are "Good", "Moderate", "Unhealthy for sensitive groups", "Unhealthy", "Very
			Unhealthy" and "Hazardous". Depending on which category <a href="/index.html">your current air quality</a> falls into, you should take precautionary measures.</p>
