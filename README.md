# AirQualityDisplay
Air Quality Display is an independent project which uses the OpenAQ.org API to display real time data of a location's Air Quality. The website is designed to give necessary information about staying safe and helping out in the war against air pollution.

Air Quality Display uses Bootstrap 4, imported from MaxCDN, for its design.
For Air Quality Data, the website sends requests to api.openaq.org.

This project was created by Dev Sharma.
